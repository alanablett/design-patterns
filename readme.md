# What's here?

Just a basic explanation and example of a number of the standard design patterns as preached by the Gang Of Four. Each pattern has a script in the root of this project, with the source files to run the example in the src folder.

# General Best Practices

* Identify the aspects of the application that vary, and separate them from what stays the same.
* Program to an interface, not an implementation.
* Favour composition over inheritance (HAS-A is better than IS-A).
* Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact.
* Classes should be open for extension, but closed for modification (open closed principle).
* Depend upon abstractions not concrete classes (dependency inversion principle).
